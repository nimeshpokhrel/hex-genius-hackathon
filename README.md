# Hajurko सहायक

## About Project

Hajurko Sahayak is a common platform that connects clients and hireling offering household services across multiple categories. Here the clients can directly interact with the people offering their service. They can choose their ideal service provider based on their needs and the ratings provided by the previous user. Furthermore, they can also leave reviews based on their experience and satisfaction level.

As for the hirelings they need to register themselves as a worker. They will also be required to submit a picture or PDF of their authentic documents (citizenship, passport, etc.) for verification. Moreover, workers can set prices for their services depending on the type of service the clients are seeking.

In the current era where everyone is busy with their own frenetic secludes, we believe that this project will help in making our lives easier and will also serve as a employment opportunity for many.
